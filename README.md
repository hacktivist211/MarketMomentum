Stock Price Prediction Using XGBoost		

Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning    

This project has been one of the most rewarding yet challenging experiences of my journey in machine learning. The idea started simple: build a model that could predict stock prices and reveal hidden patterns in the chaotic stock market. But as I got deeper into it, I realised the true complexity of the task. It wasn’t just about coding or choosing the right algorithm—it was about solving a series of interconnected problems, learning from mistakes, and growing at every step.

It’s a great idea to include step-by-step instructions in the **README.md** file. The **README** is the central place where other developers or users can easily access information about the project, including how to set up, run the model, and install necessary dependencies. 

Here’s how you can break down the instructions:

---

### **How to Run the Model**

Follow these steps to run the stock market prediction model on your local system:

#### 1. **Install Anaconda**
First, you'll need to install **Anaconda** (if it isn't already installed on your system). Anaconda is a popular distribution for data science, machine learning, and deep learning workflows. It includes Python, package management, and environment management tools.

- **Download**: Go to the [Anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and download the version that matches your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- **Install**: Follow the installation instructions on the website.

#### 2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
It's good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate its dependencies from other Python projects.

- Open **Anaconda Prompt** (or your terminal if you're on macOS/Linux) and run the following command to create a new environment:
  
  ```bash
  conda create --name stock-prediction python=3.9
  ```

  This will create a new environment named `stock-prediction` with Python 3.9. You can specify a different version of Python if needed.

- To activate the environment, run:
  
  ```bash
  conda activate stock-prediction
  ```

#### 3. **Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local system so you can work with the code.

- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project and run:
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction.git
  ```

- Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

#### 4. **Install Required Packages**
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages. You can create a `requirements.txt` file in your repository with the necessary dependencies.

For example, your `requirements.txt` file could look something like this:

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
xgboost
scikit-learn
seaborn
tensorflow
keras
```

To install these dependencies, run the following command in your terminal (make sure you're in the `stock-prediction` directory):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install each package manually with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib xgboost scikit-learn seaborn tensorflow keras
```

#### 5. **Download the Dataset**
Before running the model, you need the dataset. In this case, you’ll have a folder containing **CSV files** with stock data. 

- Place the dataset in the appropriate directory as per the project structure. The model will look for the data at this location.

#### 6. **Run the Model**
Once the environment is set up and the packages are installed, you’re ready to run the model.

- Navigate to the Python script that contains your model (e.g., `train_model.py`).
- Run the script by executing the following in your terminal:

  ```bash
  python train_model.py
  ```

- The script will train the model on the stock market data, and you'll see logs of the training process. The model will output predictions that can be visualised as `Actual vs Predicted` graphs.

#### 7. **Visualize Results**
Once the model completes the training, you’ll want to visualize the predictions. The script might generate graphs or save the results as images, which can be found in a directory like `output/`.

To view the graphs, you can use tools like **matplotlib** or **seaborn** to plot the predictions against the actual values.

#### 8. **Optional: Evaluate the Model**
After training, you may want to evaluate the model’s performance by using various metrics like **accuracy**, **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**, or **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**. These are typically calculated in the evaluation phase of the code, but you can always add additional evaluation techniques based on your needs.
